## Intro

For some reason I still enjoy trying to solve all of the never-ending problems that arise when making video games.




## Interests

Often people only sum themselves up as their professional esperiences and achedemic achievemtns (like above).

But, the impetus of this blog is pushing my current knowlege and hopefully reaching some of my future goals as a developer, leader and business person.

Here a few lists of things that are currently brewing and topics that I'm desperately trying to find more time for.


### Leadership

- Tools and techniques to align multi discipline teams
- Reducing iteration and validation time for software development
- Improving technical scoping
- Refining singal to noise ratio of communications, especially hybrid and remote orgs


### Game Tech

- Seamless player experiences
- Procedural generation, especially level design
- User generated content, 
- Co-op multiplayer


### Programming

- C++20 and beyond, and languares that compete in this space
- Data Oriented Design
- Strongly typed APIs
- Functional programming


## Future Projects



- Make my own programming language
- Finish a small game where all code and assets are mine
- Engine agnostic procedural generation libary 
- Open source engine contribution, open source investment in general!
