If you'd like to talk about shared interests, an idea you have, or something you think I can help you with, then feel free to get in touch with me via email or social media.
The links to do so can be found in the nav section, I check all of them too frequently!


Fair warning: 
* You're right my profile is a great fit for a senior programmer roles, but I'm not looking for that type of job
* I don't reply to emails that ask me to 'book a call' to hear the oppertinity
* My current project won't sign up for your paid services if you use this method of contact
